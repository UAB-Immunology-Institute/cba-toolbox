### CBA Toolbox

This software performs high-throughput, batched, automated analysis of raw cytometry (FCS) files produced using the cytometric bead array (CBA) assay as described in:

Rosenberg AF, Killian JT, Green TJ, Akther J, Hossain E, Qiu S, Randall TD, Lund FE, King RG. _A high-throughput multiplex array for antigen-specific serology with automated analysis._ bioRxiv. 2023 April. doi: 10.1101/2023.03.29.534777.

In addition to the files in this repo, three additional files from the Matlab File Exchange are required:

* fca_fcsread.m (to import FCS files) available [here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/9608-fca_readfcs)

* dscatter.m (to render density-coded scatter plots) available [here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8430-flow-cytometry-data-reader-and-visualization)

* LP4.m (four-parameter logistic) available [here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/38122-four-parameters-logistic-regression-there-and-back-again)

Refer to the Users Guide PDF for installation and usage instructions.
